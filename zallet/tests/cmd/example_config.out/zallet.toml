# Default configuration for Zallet.
#
# This file is generated as an example using Zallet's current defaults. It can
# be used as a skeleton for custom configs.
#
# Fields that are required to be set are uncommented, and set to an example
# value. Every other field is commented out, and set to the current default
# value that Zallet will use for it (or `UNSET` if the field has no default).
#
# Leaving a field commented out means that Zallet will always use the latest
# default value, even if it changes in future. Uncommenting a field but keeping
# it set to the current default value means that Zallet will treat it as a
# user-configured value going forward.
