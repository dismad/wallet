Additional use of `unsafe` to wrap `NonZeroUsize::new_unchecked`; in both cases
the argument to this method is `<Vec length or capacity> + 1`; in general this
is safe with the exception that if an existing `Vec` has length or capacity
`usize::MAX` this could wrap into zero; it would be better to use the safe
operation and then `expect` to generate a panic, rather than risk undefined
behavior.

Additions are:
- no_std support
- sorting
- `nonzero` module (just wrappers
- `serde` support
- `nonempty macro` (trivial, verified safe)
